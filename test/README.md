# TitaniumPhoenix (Reborn)
A beautiful and lightweight web-proxy site built to be easy to use and modify for everyone.

Initial Release Date: 02/11/2019.
#### Basic info

This web-app, measuring about 14.2 MB, is designed to be as light on server storage as possible.

# Features

#### Locally Stored and Hosted Proxy Server

This allows your PhoenixHub site to have a proxy already equipped when you deploy it so you can quickly get to circumventing censorship!

#### Locally Stored YouTube Proxy

Since YouTube does not work on the Local Proxy, we came up with this as a solution: The YouTube Proxy!

The YouTube Proxy allows streaming of resolutions and framerates of 4K and 60 FPS, and will allow playback of any video and it uses YouTube's URL patterns for easy of use.

**This requires you to have a YouTube Data v3 API key, which goes into the apikey config var on Heroku!

#### Games

This site has links to many games on a JSCDN for quick and efficient access.

#### Chatboxes

Chatboxes for TitaniumNetwork's Services. Replace if needed.

#### Suggest Some Stuff!
